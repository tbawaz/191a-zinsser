# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Tristan Biles

Zinsser’s main points came under two different topics: simplicity and clutter. Zinsser stresses the importance of simplicity in writing. He gives credit that writing is hard work and that “a clear sentence is no accident.” Additionally, he believes that “writing improves in direct ratio to the number of things we can keep out that shouldn’t be there.” He defines clutter as something which pushes out the short word that reads the same thing. Zinsser provides an exercise of bracketing every component that isn’t doing useful work and then deleting it from the section to improve the paper.
